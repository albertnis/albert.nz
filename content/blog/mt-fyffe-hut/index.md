What a marvellous hut to visit as an overnighter from Christchurch! The day of our descent was incredibly windy and had us abandoning an attempt to summit Mt Fyffe after getting sandblasted on the way up from the hut. It wasn't all unpleasant, however: we got to witness an amazing sunset climbing up to the hut, followed by an even more amazing sunrise in the morning. It's breathtaking to see Kaikōura Peninsula from this angle.

The track to the hut is easy-going and could be safely walked at night by flashlight. Note that the hut is popular and had scarce water in the tank when we visited. Pack in plenty of water, and either arrive early to claim a bunk or bring a tent as backup.
