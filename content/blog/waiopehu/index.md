The walk to Waiopehu Hut is a straightforward but steady climb up a ridgeline. Lovely dense forest surrounds the track to the hut, which sits near the bushline. The hut ostensibly has remarkable views out to Levin and the coast--surely a great introduction to tramping for the member of our party who was new to the activity. Of course, we received dense low cloud the whole time we were up there.

I'd like to come back here in better weather and potentially create a longer loop with Gable End Ridge.
