Mention the Pencarrow lakes to most Wellingtonians and they'll have no idea what you're talking about--just like so many of the coolest outdoors attractions in the region. Beyond the well-known Pencarrow Head, there are tracks all around these coastal lakes. With so many cool picnic and sightseeing spots, allow more time than I did and make a day of it. If it's sunny, bring plenty of sunscreen also.

> The boardwalk/bridge across upper Lake Kohangapiripiri closed for maintenance shortly after I did this walk. Please double check that it has reopened before attempting.
