This hugely popular Great Walk is a great challenge to tackle in a day. We ran it counter-clockwise. The first half has some nice high sections before ducking into the bush for a pretty but monotonous second half.

I hear the views from the ridgeline parts are expansive and some of the best in New Zealand. Unfortunately we received low cloud and only received brief glimpses of the surroundings.
