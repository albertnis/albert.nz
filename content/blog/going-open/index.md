Recently I decided to upgrade my computer audio experience to match my improving and expanding music library. So I bought a DAC and some new headphones. The former is the [Audioquest Dragonfly v1][dac], a well-reviewed DAC which I got for the ridiculous(ly low) price of $99 in a clearance sale at [Online Hi-Fi][online-hifi]. It took a lot longer to come to a decision on new headphones. After doing some research, I decided going open-back would be a good upgrade from my closed-back Sennheiser HD-212 Pros. I went to the absolute gem of a store which is [The Listening Post][tlp] where they have a whole lot of mid-range headphones available for audition with an amp. The staff directed me straight to the Grado SR125i, on sale for $199. I was expecting the bass to be a let down with open-backed heaphones such as these, but the Grados had enough deep bass for a bit of electronic music. The Sennheiser HD-558 was quickly dismissed for lack of bass, despite its quite frankly astounding comfort. I had a quick listen to the store's Audio-Technica ATH-M50x (a headphone I had listened to many times before) and the bass seemed boomy and confined after the open-backed offerings. I settled on the Grado SR125i.

The Dragonfly-SR125i combo has been a revelation for me in many ways. Rock music has come alive with a new level of detail. In more simple tracks like R.E.M.'s _Nightswimming_, the action of the piano is clear and vocals are reasonably forward. Complex tracks such as _Dirty Work_ by Steely Dan sound layered. I'll admit it though, while the SR125i's bass does have decent extension (Clean Bandit's _Nightingale_ is a great subbass test) and presence, it lacks the punch of my trusty HD-212 Pros. I'll definitely be keeping my previous headphones for their extremely fun (if far-from-neutral) sound signature, which is well suited to electronic music, as well as for their isolation.
