Inspired by a recent trip to <a data-sveltekit-reload href="/avalanche-peak">Avalanche Peak</a>, I sought out another peak for a day trip. Travers Peak checked most of the boxes. It's similar to the Avalanche Peak track in many ways but it is unmarked on the tops, with expansive views across the mountain ranges surrounding Lewis Pass.

Access is easy--park at Deer Valley campsite then go straight up Foley's Track to the bushline. After this, it's a matter of following the ridge to the summit. There are a couple of particularly steep sections, but cairns and the occasional pole help to navigate. We made it to the summit in just over two hours. If you're doing this trip, be wary of the steep dropoffs to the south of the final ridge climb.

The peak itself has a few nice nooks to sit down and enjoy some snacks while enjoying the stunning view. It's amazing how open the tops are around here. Traversing the Libretto Range--or at least spending a night camping up here--could be a fun challenge.
