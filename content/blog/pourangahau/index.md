A popular hill walk near St Arnaud is the Mt Robert loop which takes walkers up Pourangahau / Mt Robert a few kilometres southeast of the town. The 9km loop is comprised of two tracks: Paddy's Track, a gentle trail passing Bushline Hut; and the lower section of Pinchgut Track which consists of steep switchbacks to the roadend carpark. We wanted a less steep trail so opted to take Paddy's Track up to Relax shelter near the summit and return the same way (11km total).

# Back in St Arnaud

We were only in town for a couple of nights but enjoyed heading down to Lake Rotoiti which was a short walk from our accomodation. I already want to come back to this region, possibly for some fast-packing in summer - there are so many interesting longer trails to explore.
