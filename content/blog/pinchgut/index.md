Pinchgut Track is a 5km walk near Rangiora leading to Pinchgut Hut. It's a short, easy track which is popular with families. After tramping this one I realised I barely took any photos.

The track starts with a river crossing right near the carpark. We did the walk in autumn and the crossing was trivial. As usual, though, check forecasts--especially if walking with young ones.

It's also worth noting that the hut gets busy! I'd highly recommend our route--leave early, drop bags at the hut, then do the 12km loop in the hills with daypacks. It makes the excursion nicely challenging and means you can claim a bunk early.
