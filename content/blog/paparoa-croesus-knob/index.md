During a stay in the nearby town of Blackball, we walked from the trailhead to the top of Croesus Knob and back, passing Ces Clark hut. This is the first day or so of the Paparoa Track, with a turn off at the saddle to reach Croesus Knob proper. It's a decent distance for a day trip but the track is very well graded.
