This counterclockwise loop made for a great trail run about a half-marathon in length. The uphills and downhills are fairly steep but worth it for about a kilometre of good travel along the subalpine tops. I would recommend the side trip to Ryde Falls, especially on a warm day. A longer and even hillier daytrip could be created by making a detour to Wharfedale Hut.

![The best part of the run is the tops travel: it's good trail with panoramic views. The descent becomes steeper after dipping below the bushline.][running]

![Ryde Falls. The detour doesn't add much distance to the total and it was lovely to cool our feet in the pool at the falls' base.][falls]
