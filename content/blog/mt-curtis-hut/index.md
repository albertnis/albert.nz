An idle evening of scrolling topo maps lead me to learn about this hut situated near Mt Curtis on the West Coast. The hut is publicly accessible but is not a DOC hut; rather, it is maintained by a community group. It was rebuilt in 2012 by the group with some of the funding coming from DOC. The track to the hut is unmapped near private land and there's scant information on the internet. As I attempted to interpret the terse trip reports that are available, I became more and more intrigued by this well-kept secret. I had to go! So I planned an overnighter in this rugged part of the country.

What follows is hopefully a more complete description of getting to and from Mt Curtis Hut. It is up-to-date as at time of writing.

## How to get to Mt Curtis Hut

Access is from the bridge which crosses Dee Creek, just East of Inangahua. There's a decent-sized layby on the West end of the bridge for parking. Cross to the Eastern side of the bridge and descend to the river on the true right. You'll have to jump a fence. The next step is to follow Dee Creek for a couple of kilometres--there are no markings in this section and travel is through farmland along a paper road which follows the river.

Eventually the river plunges into forest. Continue following the river until you reach point 1515277E 5364463N on the TL bank. At this point there exists a marked trail but you need to head directly away from the river to find it. Look for orange and pink ribbons visible from the side creek a few metres to the south of the main river. If you struggle to find it, consider continuing 100-300m further up the main river then bush-bashing south to intercept the track while it is close to the river. The track runs vaguely parallel to the river at first, tracking the top of the bluffs marked on Topo50. It then moves to follow the spur past Pt 489 and all the way up to the hut, becoming increasingly well-marked along the way. We encountered a wasp-infested section of beech about halfway along the trail--watch out for that if you're doing this tramp in the summer months.

## How we got to Mt Curtis Hut

This, of course, was not the way we went up. Only after coming back down do I have the privilege of describing the actual track to you.

With such concealed marking and little information, we completely missed the turnoff for the track, heading up the river for another few hours. Dee Creek develops gorge sections higher up, which led to beautiful sights, slow travel and steep bush-bashing to bypass unnavigable parts. Eventually we were presented with an opportunity to depart the river towards the TL branch in the direction of the hut. We took the opportunity. Fully prepared to bash the remaining two kilometres to the hut, we first headed to the spur inspired by a report of a track on one of the spurs in the area. After pushing through scrub for a while, we found an orange track marker! The going got steep shortly afterwards and it was amazing to experience the shift from mentally-exhausting bush-bashing to physically-exhausting climbing.

## The hut itself

We were greeted by a weka scurrying through the flax near the hut. (An entire family of weka walked past while I was on the toilet in the morning. I think they like it up there!)

Mt Curtis Hut is a modern-but-basic four-bunker with a spare fifth mattress. The hut book indicates a bit over a dozen visits per year. There's a fairly well-stocked pantry here with a few pots and pans. It's double-glazed and we certainly had no need for the fire on this clear summer's night. The hut sits just below the bushline and the view is largely obscured by trees. Just five minutes' walk up the hill (quite doable in sandals) took us to a small knoll which has unobstructed views to the West. Mt Curtis summit itself is also easily accessible but might be more appropriate for a two-night stay.

## The return

Descending the marked track was an excellent experience and one we had been looking forward to since the previous day. We expected to have missed an obvious turnoff but once we got to the bottom of the track the markers thinned then stopped well out of sight of Dee Creek. So in the end we didn't have any reason to beat ourselves up for missing the track on the way up.

Out trip in took 6.5 hours. Out, it was under 3.5.
